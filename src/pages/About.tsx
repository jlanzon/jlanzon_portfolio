              With over seven years of dedicated service as an ICT Technician in
              the Royal Air Force, I have cultivated profound expertise in
              information technology and software development. My academic
              journey in Information Technology began at Fareham College,
              setting the stage for a robust career in the Ministry of Defence.
              Currently positioned as a Lead Software Developer at RAF
              Coningsbyâ€™s Mission Support Centre, I excel in creating bespoke
              web applications that enhance mission effectiveness and
              operational support.
            </p>
            <p className="py-6">
              I am highly proficient in Full-Stack Development with specialized
              skills in Python, Angular, React, and Firebase, bolstered by
              command line and version control proficiency using CMD and Git. My
              technical expertise extends to PowerBI,
              HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript, UX/UI Design, Cybersecurity,
              Artificial Intelligence (including Large Language Models), and
              Microsoft Azure DevSecOps, equipping me with a diverse and modern
              IT skill set.

            <p className="py-6">
              Besides coding, I enjoy engaging in outdoor activities like hiking
              and running. I also enjoy listening to podcasts and audiobooks,
              undertaking DIY projects, playing games with friends, and
              cherishing time spent with my daughter.
